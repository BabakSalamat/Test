The code is written in a modular manner. It is possible to change the topology of the net. This allows assessing the performance of the classifier.

The code consists of four fundamental steps. The steps are in the following:

Implementation steps:
    1- Initialization and data prepration (Train/Validation/Test)
    2- Creating layers and model
    3- Setting training parameters (loss and optimization functions)
    4- Train the model
